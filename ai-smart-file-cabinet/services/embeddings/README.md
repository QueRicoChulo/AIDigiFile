# AI Smart File Cabinet - Embeddings Service

This directory contains the implementation and documentation for the embeddings service of the AI Smart Digital File Cabinet project. The embeddings service is responsible for managing the creation and retrieval of embeddings for ingested files, enabling efficient search and retrieval functionalities.

## Overview

The embeddings service plays a crucial role in transforming ingested files into a format that can be easily searched and analyzed. By generating embeddings, we can represent files in a high-dimensional space, allowing for more sophisticated search capabilities based on content similarity.

## Features

- **Embedding Creation**: Generate embeddings for various file types upon ingestion.
- **Embedding Retrieval**: Retrieve embeddings for files to facilitate search operations.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with the ingestion and search services to provide a cohesive experience.

## Usage

To use the embeddings service, ensure that it is properly integrated with the backend application. The service should be instantiated and called within the appropriate controller or service that handles file operations.

## Development

For developers looking to contribute to the embeddings service, please refer to the following guidelines:

1. **Code Structure**: Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions.
2. **Testing**: Ensure that all new features are accompanied by appropriate tests.
3. **Documentation**: Update this README file as necessary to reflect changes in functionality or usage.
